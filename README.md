# Gatherpress Alpha

As we continue to refine and develop GatherPress, please use the GatherPress Alpha plugin alongside the core GatherPress plugin. The Alpha plugin helps manage breaking changes effectively:

- Ensure that the version of GatherPress Alpha matches the version of the core GatherPress plugin.
- Activate both plugins.
- Navigate to the `Alpha` tab under `Events -> Settings` in the WordPress admin.
- Click `Fix GatherPress!` to resolve any compatibility issues.

## How to Determine Which Version to Install

1. **Check Your GatherPress Version**: Go to your website’s admin, navigate to the “Plugins” section, and locate GatherPress in the list of installed plugins. Note the version number currently installed.
2. **Find the Matching Release**: Visit the `Releases` section on this page (or the relevant repository) and locate the release that matches the version of GatherPress you have installed.
3. **Download the Plugin**: Under the `Assets` section of the matching release, find and click on `gatherpress-alpha.zip` to download it.
4. **Install the Plugin**: In your website’s admin, go to `Plugins` > `Add New Plugin` and upload the `gatherpress-alpha.zip` file you just downloaded.
5. **Repeat for Updates**: Follow these steps for each GatherPress update to ensure compatibility.

This process helps us manage technical debt effectively as we work towards the launch of version 1.0.0 of the plugin.
