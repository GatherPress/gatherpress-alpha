# Gatherpress Alpha

As we continue to refine and develop GatherPress, please use the GatherPress Alpha plugin alongside the core GatherPress plugin. The Alpha plugin manages breaking changes easily: just make sure GatherPress Alpha is the same version as GatherPress, activate both plugins, go to the Alpha section under GatherPress Settings, and click "Fix GatherPress!" after updating GatherPress. This process helps us avoid technical debt as we work towards launching version 1.0.0 of the plugin.
